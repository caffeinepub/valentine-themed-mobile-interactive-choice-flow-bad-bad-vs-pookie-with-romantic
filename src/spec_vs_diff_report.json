However, required generated image files are not shown as added, the exact Valentine message text requirement is not met due to wording differences, and authentication/Internet Identity wiring was introduced despite being a non-goal/constraint.",

      "reason": "The implemented message is split into multiple sentences with different capitalization and wording; specifically it uses \"you're the highlight of my day\" instead of the requested \"you're highlight of my day\" and does not present the sentiment as the provided text.",
